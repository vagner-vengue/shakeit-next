## About the project

Shake.IT is a web application based on the Pomodoro Technique, but with additional functionalities and dedicated to IT professionals.

Most of the IT professionals spend several hours in front of the computer without streching, what can lead to health problems.
So, Shake.IT aims to help these professionals to find a balance between focus time and straching time, by suggesting popular and simple straching exercises. It also brings a schema of points for each completed exercise, challenging the users to continue using it and grow in points and levels.
